# tbpbot
Here is a Telegram bot that I developed with Google Apps Script to automate and facilitate my data entry for my side business. This bot communicates with Google Sheets to retrieve and enter information.

Features:
- Inline keyboard with new order/expense format instructions
- Add new orders using specified format & sorts by date
- Add new expenses using specified format (with duplicate receipt id checks)
- Generate a summary of orders for today and the next few days
- Viewing sales and expense summary from Google Sheets 
- Whitelisting specific user ids

For your own use, please enter your own:
- Telegram bot token
- Google Sheets spreadsheet id
- Whitelisted user ids
- Web app url (to be changed after each new deployment)
